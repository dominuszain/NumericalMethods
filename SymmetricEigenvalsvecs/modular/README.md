there are a few things to keep in mind. first of all, never ever pass arrays to subroutines in fortran. i will almost always result in segmentation faults. you can get around that by writing arrays to storage, and then reading them from the storage in the subroutines. also, always use the makefile. many times, manual compilation gives the wrong answers. this modular way is the way to go in the future.
