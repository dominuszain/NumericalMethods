This folder will contain my solutions to integrals using the monte-carlo method. The main difference between the reimann sum approximation method and the monte-carlo method is that in the former, we calculate the values of functions at all points in the domain with a fixed step while in the later, we calculate the value of the function at a fixed number of randomly chosen points. The integrals converge in accordance with the law of large numbers from statistics.
